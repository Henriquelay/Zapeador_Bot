This is my first 'actual' program using Python.  
Don't expect much.

---

## Running locally
### Dependencies
I made the program itself using [Python3.8.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-381/), so make sure you have that properly installed.  
Install `pipenv` with `python3.8 -m pip install pipenv --user`.

### Virtual Enviroment
Run `pipenv install` on the root directory of the project.  
* Use `pipenv shell` to enter your newly-created virtual enviroment, as a shell.  
* Exit shell however you like to exit it.
